# Unlocked Greek Lexicon

The objectives of this project are to provide a New Testament Greek Lexicon that:

  - Is **free of copyright and licensing restrictions** (CC BY-SA), permitting the entire global Church to use and build on it without hindrance.
  - Is **based on existing work** of excellent pedigree and academic repute.
  - Is **translated** into all the [Gateway Languages](https://unfoldingword.org/gateway) of the world, and any other language in which the Church desires to have a Greek lexicon.


## Description

The first version will be Abbott-Smith's Manual Greek Lexicon of the NT. This text is available from https://github.com/translatable-exegetical-tools/Abbott-Smith. (This was completed in January 2017). 

For the second version, we will finish cleaning up this A-S text and then release it as an exact representation, in digital form, of the A-S printed lexicon.

The third version will be produced by updating A-S so that the entries reflect better glosses and are enhanced with true definitions in agreement with other lexica (e.g., BDAG, Louw-Nida). The entries will be edited in order to be clear for speakers of English as a second language, since this reflects our first target audience.

As time and resources allow, it is our desire to produce two other related tools. One will be a dictionary similar to WordNet (http://wordnet.princeton.edu/) which would be useful for translators to see the full range of words found in a given domain. The other will be a corpus-based advanced learner's dictionary as described in Todd L. Price, Structural Lexicology and the Greek New Testament: Applying Corpus Linguistics for Word Sense Possibility Delimitation Using Collocational Indicators \[Perspectives on Linguistics and Ancient Languages 6] (Gorgias: Piscataway, NJ, 2015).
