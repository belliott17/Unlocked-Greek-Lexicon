# Unlocked Greek Lexicon

The objectives of this project are to provide a New Testament Greek Lexicon that:

  - Is **free of copyright and licensing restrictions** (public domain / CC0), permitting the entire global Church to use and build on it without hindrance.
  - Is **based on existing work** of excellent pedigree and academic repute.
  - Is **translated** into all the [Gateway Languages](https://unfoldingword.org/gateway) of the world, and any other language in which the Church desires to have a Greek lexicon.
